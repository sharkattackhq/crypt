Display Crypto Values on MBP Touch Bar

A pet project to display crypto currency values on a MacBook Pro's Touch Bar. Inspired by reddit.com/user/Diix, but this app has no dependencies (whereas Diix's one requires BetterTouchTool).

Launch the app and watch your touch bar. Wait for the data to get fetched and then it will display the current GBP, AUD and USD values of BTC, ETH and LTC. You can cycle through the fiat currancies my pressing on the fiat button.

At the moment the app is super dumb - the currency API calls are hard-coded, but I'll allow users to add their own currencies in an upcoming version. 

Contributions are very welcome! I'm a web developer, not an OSX dev, so Xcode and Swift are brand new to me. If you want to contribute then prepare for some messy code!
